### Writing Tests with Data Tables

Example feature file with data tables:

```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  Scenario Outline: Login with different credentials
    Given I navigate to the login page
    When I enter the following credentials:
      | username   | password   |
      | <username> | <password> |
    Then I should see "<result>"

    Examples:
      | username | password | result        |
      | admin    | admin123 | Welcome Admin |
      | user     | user123  | Welcome User  |
      | invalid  | wrong    | Login Failed  |
```
